# Churn Prediction Project

Welcome to my **Churn Prediction** project! This project is part of my learning journey in Business Analytics, where I used machine learning to predict customer churn based on retail data.

## Project Overview

In this project, I used a retail dataset to calculate Recency, Frequency, and Monetary (RFM) values for each customer and predict their likelihood of churn. The model was built using a **Random Forest Classifier**.

## How to Set Up and Run the Project

Follow the steps below to set up and run this project on your local machine:

```bash
# Step 1: Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/manoharpragada1/churn-prediction-project.git

# Step 2: Navigate to the project directory
cd churn-prediction-project

# Step 3: Create a virtual environment
python -m venv venv

# Step 4: Activate the virtual environment
# For Windows:
.\venv\Scripts\activate
# For macOS/Linux:
source venv/bin/activate

# Step 5: Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Step 6: Run the churn prediction script
python churn_prediction.py


In this version:

- All the setup commands are combined into a single code block under the "How to Set Up and Run the Project" section.
- Comments are added within the code block to indicate different steps and to provide instructions for both Windows and macOS/Linux when activating the virtual environment.
- This format allows you to copy and paste all the commands at once, making it convenient to set up the project.

**Note:** When activating the virtual environment, be sure to run the appropriate command for your operating system.
